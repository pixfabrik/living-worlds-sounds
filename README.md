# Living Worlds Sounds

A place to collaborate on sounds for the [Living Worlds app](https://pixfabrik.com/livingworlds/). All the action is over in the [issues](https://github.com/pixfabrik/living-worlds-sounds/issues), but here's some important context...

## What We're Looking For

We have the technology to play multiple simultaneous sounds of two types:

* Continuous loops
* Random intermittent sounds

For instance in the night, we might have a continuous loop of wind blowing through trees, and play random intermittent owl hoots. With multiple loops, we can have both waterfall and rain sounds at the same time.

Ideally we want separate sounds for each element. This allows us to vary how the sounds come and go and mix with each other, giving a richer, more like-like experience. So instead of a single "forest night sounds" loop, we would want separate sound files for wind, crickets, and owls. The wind and crickets could be continuous loops, and the owls could be chopped into individual hoots so we can vary their sequence.

Of course the sounds we use need to be legal for us to use commercially, and to edit. I expect most sounds in this category will require attribution, and we've got a [credits page](https://pixfabrik.com/livingworlds/credits/) set up for this.

## Places To Look

Let me know if you know of others!

## Let's Get To It!

Ultimately we'll want to do all of the scenes, but I think it would be helpful if we focus on the upcoming scenes, with the hope of getting enough sounds together to release a version of the app with at least one month's worth of sounds in time for that month to be the current month. I originally hoped that could be [June](https://github.com/pixfabrik/living-worlds-sounds/issues/1), but June is approaching and we're not ready yet. I've started issues for [July](https://github.com/pixfabrik/living-worlds-sounds/issues/5), [August](https://github.com/pixfabrik/living-worlds-sounds/issues/6), and [September](https://github.com/pixfabrik/living-worlds-sounds/issues/3), and we can work on those simultaneously. Hopefully one of them will be ready in time! 

Please click into one of those months for information about the sounds we need. ðŸ˜Š
