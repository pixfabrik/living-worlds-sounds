# Living Worlds Sounds

A place to collaborate on sounds for the [Living Worlds app](https://pixfabrik.com/livingworlds/). All the action is over in the [issues](https://github.com/pixfabrik/living-worlds-sounds/issues), but here's some important context...

## What We're Looking For

We have the technology to play multiple simultaneous sounds of two types:

* Continuous loops
* Random intermittent sounds

For instance in the night, we might have a continuous loop of wind blowing through trees, and play random intermittent owl hoots. With multiple loops, we can have both waterfall and rain sounds at the same time.

Ideally we want separate sounds for each element. This allows us to vary how the sounds come and go and mix with each other, giving a richer, more like-like experience. So instead of a single "forest night sounds" loop, we would want separate sound files for wind, crickets, and owls. The wind and crickets could be continuous loops, and the owls could be chopped into individual hoots so we can vary their sequence.

Of course the sounds we use need to be legal for us to use commercially, and to edit. I expect most sounds in this category will require attribution, and we've got a [credits page](https://pixfabrik.com/livingworlds/credits/) set up for this.

Let me know if you know of others!

## Let's Get To It!

Ultimately we'll want to do all of the scenes, but I think it would be helpful if we focus on one at a time. For starters, let's see what we can do for June. I started a [June issue](https://github.com/pixfabrik/living-worlds-sounds/issues/1) for us to discuss in.
